        "title": "What is the Difference Between Micro Resource and Medical Resource?",
        "answer": "The only difference between Micro Resource and Medical Resource is that the connection point is thinner and smaller. We find the medical resource application correct only to prevent visibility around the head when hair is gathered, and we prefer it in thin, weak hair."
      },
      "q2": {
        "title": "How is Micro Resource Applied?",
        "answer": "In the micro resource system, hair strands to be transplanted are transplanted to the hair with 5 and 25 strands. In this sense, the connection point is quite small and natural.",
        "detail": "The Micro Hair Resource technique, which is applied professionally in our salon, is one of the latest hair resource techniques applied in the world. The process is done by melting transparent capsule granules with heat and combining them with hair."
      },
      "q3": {
        "title": "Who is Micro Resource Suitable For?",
        "answer": "It is suitable for all hair types who want to extend their hair, have weak and sparse hair, and at the same time have been damaged by chemical processes, burned, worn out, with dense roots, sparse ends and low volume. With the feature of being applicable to all different hair types, resource can be made to extremely short hair (even 5 cm is sufficient)."
      },
      "q4": {
        "title": "What is the Usage Period of Micro Resource?",
        "answer": "You don't feel any pain or discomfort in your hair during the time the resource is made. When you get tired of your resources, you can also remove them without harming your hair and return to your old hair.",
        "tip": {
          "title": "Our Recommendation:",
          "description": "Minimum 3, maximum 6 months. After 3 months, the transplanted hair moves away from the roots and tangles will begin to form in your own hair."
        }
      },
      "q5": {
        "title": "Does Micro Resource Damage Hair?",
        "answer": "To be honest, with our PROFESSIONAL opinion, we don't think there is any type of resource that doesn't damage hair. There are two main reasons for hair damage: due to user errors and due to practitioner errors.",
        "important": {
          "title": "Important:",
          "description": "If general hair loss is 10% in any resource system, this rate drops to 1% in micro resource if correct hair selection, correct application, correct use and correct removal process are done."
        }
      },
      "q6": {
        "title": "What are the Advantages of Micro Resource?",
        "advantage1": "The applied hair strands are quite thin and light, they don't weigh on your head and don't bother you.",
        "advantage2": "Unlike other hair resource systems, there is no separate incompatible layered appearance from your hair, it becomes a natural and integrated total appearance.",
        "advantage3": "It is very easy to use, saves you time from styling.",
        "advantage4": "Unlike other hair extension systems, you can brush your hair from the roots with a brush.",
        "advantage5": "It can be applied to all hair types, even in very short hair, a natural appearance can be achieved with amazing results.",
        "advantage6": "Micro resource, when applied correctly, protects hair and speeds up the healing process during the treatment of burned hair.",
        "advantage7": "In micro resource studies we apply on natural hair, we prefer to apply chemical coloring processes on transplanted hair."
      },
      "q7": {
        "title": "How Many Hours is Micro Hair Resource Applied?",
        "answer": "Micro Resource application varies depending on the amount to be applied. But to give an average, our application time varies between 2-4 hours excluding coloring."
      },
      "q8": {
        "title": "How are Micro Resource Hair Removed?",
        "answer": "The applied Micro Hair resources are removed by a professional with a special solvent solution formulated for micro resource and a pliers after the recommended use. Then, if any, tangles are opened by combing with the help of an effective special softening spray product against tangling."
